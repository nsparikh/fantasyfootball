TO DO LIST
==========

Data tasks:
- Get updated depth chart kickers?
- fix players with height=0 or weight=0, no DOB, no number
	- double check players' positions
- Get Matchups for pre/postseason games?
- Get matchups, team assignments, depth positions (?) from Yahoo API


High Priority:
- Fix search box on players table page
- Complete individual player pages for D/ST, Kickers
- If no current season data for a given player, display stats from last season?
- Get rest of data
	- Fantasy points / projections (historic)
	- Create CareerData model
- Add pagination to graph?
- Draft K position detail page
	- Change QB position detail page ?
- Make players graph better -- use a different metric for normalization?
- Update current team for all players
	- Add team to yeardata? 
- Add "blank" image for players who don't have one (or show team photo?)
	- Get images for D/ST (i.e. team logos)
	- Add team logos to Team pages
- Fix team detail, position detail pages to show only players on that team in the selected year?

UI Fixes:
- Highlight selected tab in nav bar on players/positions/teams pages
- Fix 'F. Lastname' on position detail page for players with middle name or suffix
- Fix text overlap when hovering on d/st bottom graph
	- fix flicker on hover (i.e. hover on whole bar on bottom graph, not each individual piece)
- Make position detail tables sortable

Quick Fixes:
- on pages that calculate weekly averages (position detail pages, d/st detail page), if the week hasn't happened yet then subtract 1 from total number of weeks


Low Priority:
- Add new DataPoint with all 0's; replace those in GameDataPoints and YearDataPoints
- Change url paths to use names instead of IDs for positions, teams, maybe players?
- figure out how to "toggle" links from asc/desc when clicked again
- Add current status to player pages

Eventual:
- Set up something to get data automatically each week
	- Write something that will write the new data to fixture files after each update
- Machine learning stuff - augment game data with projection info
- Get historical data for past 5 years
- Add side-by-side comparison page
- User model -- see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/auth/
- Make sure everything works on other browsers
- Look into ESPN terms of service...are we breaking any rules? for data / images?
- Figure out AWS for storing images, etc.
