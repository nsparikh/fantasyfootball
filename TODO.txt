TO DO LIST
==========

Data issues:
- Fix GameData with null date / espn game ID that aren't Bye weeks
- Fix Garrett Hartley 2013 Game Data (was on a team but now FA)
	- FIgure out actual BYE weeks for these players
- Fix Johnnie Lee Higgins GameData (middle name issue)
- fix players with height=0 or weight=0, no DOB, no number
	- double check players' positions


High Priority:
- Complete individual player pages
	- Figure out individual pages for D/ST, Kickers; get necessary data
- Get rest of data
	- Fantasy points / projections (historic)
	- Create CareerData model? Would have to keep it updated throughout the season	
- Add pagination to graph?
- Fix search box on players table page
- Draft rest of position analysis pages (QB, TE, RB, D/ST, K)
	- TE, RB, QB, K(?) will be like WR page
	- D/ST will be like graph from paper (for now)
- Make players graph better -- use a different metric for normalization?
- Add request params to specify year / week? Or handle through sessions: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/http/sessions/
- Update current team for all players
	- Add team to yeardata? 
- Add "blank" image for players who don't have one (or show team photo?)
	- Get images for D/ST (i.e. team logos)
- Add average # fantasy points per game to player page ?
	

Quick Fixes:
- Add tooltips to player table headers
- Highlight selected tab in nav bar on players/positions/teams pages
- Change date format on player detail page hover box
- Clean up code in player_detail_weekly_graph.js (particulary in mousemove function)
- Add new DataPoint with all 0's; replace those in GameDataPoints and YearDataPoints
- Fix links on player detail page (to position and team)


Low Priority:
- Change url paths to use names instead of IDs for positions, teams, maybe players?
- figure out how to "toggle" links from asc/desc when clicked again
- figure out which players don't have images and find alternatives ?
- Add more info to player pages
	- Depth chart position
	- Current status (i.e. injured)
- Make it so clicking on a week on player_detail graph opens ESPN game log for that game

Eventual:
- Get 2014 data. Set up something to get it automatically each week
- Machine learning stuff
	- augment game data with projection info
	- for games in the past, add actual points to projections tab
- Get historical data for past 5 years
- Add side-by-side comparison page
- User model -- see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/auth/
- Make sure everything works on other browsers
- Look into ESPN terms of service...are we breaking any rules? for data / images?
- Figure out AWS for storing images, etc.
